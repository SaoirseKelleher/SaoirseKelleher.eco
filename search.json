My research interests revolve around improving methods for describing field ecological data, with emphasis on supporting applied ecologists in fitting models for their study systems.\n \n  \n   \n  \n    \n     Email\n  \n  \n    \n     Github\n  \n\n\n\n\nResearch interests\n\nOccupancy models\nMy PhD research is centred on methods for building occupancy models, with emphasis on covariate selection and complexity in multi-season models for describing patterns of species occurrence across space and time.\n\n\nConservation technology\nIncreasingly popular technologies, including camera traps and bioacoustic monitors, have introduced new and interesting data types for ecological research. I am interested in methods for analysing this data to explore patterns of species activity across scales.\n\n\nOpen Science\nI am committed to open science principles and improving transparency in Ecological research."
